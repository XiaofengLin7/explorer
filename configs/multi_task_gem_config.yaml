# Multi-Task GEM Training Configuration
#
# This configuration file defines multiple GEM tasks for training and validation.
# You can specify separate tasks for training and validation, allowing you to
# train on some tasks and validate on different tasks.
#
# Format:
#   train_tasks: List of task configurations for training
#     - env_id: GEM environment identifier (e.g., "game:Minesweeper-v0-only-reveal")
#     - max_turns_per_episode: Maximum number of turns allowed per episode for this task
#     - total_step_cap: Maximum total steps across all episodes for this task
#     - train_size: Number of training examples to generate for this task (optional, default: 512)
#
#   val_tasks: List of task configurations for validation
#     - env_id: GEM environment identifier
#     - max_turns_per_episode: Maximum number of turns allowed per episode for this task
#     - total_step_cap: Maximum total steps across all episodes for this task
#     - test_size: Number of validation examples to generate for this task (optional, default: 64)
